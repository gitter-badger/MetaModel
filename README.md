MetaModel is an iOS framework designed to help developer to deal with data persistent, JSON parsing and a bunch of APIs which provides an approach of handling client side database very easily.

> MetaModel is under-development, API may constantly change before gets to 1.0.0.

+ [x] Dealing with database without writing SQL
+ [x] Most concise API to retrieve data from persistent level
+ [ ] Fastest JSON to model API

MetaModel provides convenience chainable APIs to manipulate models like ActiveRecord.

```swift
let json = ["id": 1, "name": "Buzz", "email": "i@metamodel.info"]
let person = Person.parse(json)

// INSERT INTO "people" (id, name, email) VALUES (1, "Buzz", "i@metamodel.info")
person.save

// SELECT "people".* FROM "people" WHERE "people"."id" = 1 LIMIT 1
if var person = Person.find(1) {
    // UPDATE "people" SET "people"."name") = "Buzz" WHERE "people"."id" = 1
    person.update(name: "Draven")
}

// SELECT "people".* FROM "people"
print(Person.all)
```

## Usage

Use Metafile in project folder to define your model:

```ruby
metamodel_version '0.1.0'

define :Article do
  attr :title
  attr :content

  has_many :comments
end

define :Comment do
  attr :content

  belongs_to :article
end
```

And then run `meta build` will automatically generate all the code you need.

## Installation

```
sudo gem install metamodel --verbose
```

## Quick Start

After installation , run `meta init` in your iOS project root folder which will make a `meta` directory in current folder.

```shell
$ cd /path/to/project
$ meta init

Initialing MetaModel project

Creating `Metafile` for MetaModel
```

Generate your model meta file with `meta generate`.

```shell
$ meta generate Article

Generating model meta file

-> Adding `Article` model to Metafile

[!] Adding `Article` model scaffold to Metafile, use the command below to edit it.

  vim Metafile
```

Edit meta file using vim, Emacs or other editor and run `meta build`.

```shell
$ meta build

Building MetaModel.framework in project
  Existing project `./metamodel/MetaModel.xcodeproj`

Analyzing Metafile
  -> Resolving `Article`
  -> Resolving `Comment`

Generating model files
  -> Using Article.swift file
  -> Using Comment.swift file

[!] Please drag MetaModel.framework into Embedded Binaries phrase.
```

This command build a `MetaModel.framework` in project root folder, you need to add this framework to **Embedded Binaries** phrase which located in `General` tab.
